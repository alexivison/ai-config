# Code Review Guidelines

Guidelines for reviewing code and PRs.

## Reference Documentation

- **Review Guidelines**: `~/.claude/skills/reviewing-code/reference/review-guidelines.md`

## When to Use

- Reviewing PRs
- Checking code against quality standards
- Evaluating frontend code (React, CSS, tests)

## Key Principles

1. **Quality focus** - Reviews aim to improve code quality (readability, architecture, best practices)
2. **Psychological safety** - Reviews are about code, never personal
3. **Minimize round-trips** - Be clear, specific, provide reasons
4. **Small PRs** - Target ~100-200 lines for effective review
