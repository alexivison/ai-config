# Development Rules

## Git & PRs
- Use `gh` for GitHub operations
- Look for PR templates when creating PRs
- Create draft PRs unless instructed otherwise
- Create branches from `main`

## Task Workflow
- Wait for user approval before moving to next task in multi-task implementations
- Update checkboxes in plan files (PLAN.md, TASK*.md) after completing tasks

## Code Comments
- Keep comments short and to the point
- Only add remarks to logically difficult code
